<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

<p>Refactoring is the process of improving the design of a program without
changing its external behaviour. While refactoring by hand is possible, tool
support for refactoring is invaluable as it is more reliable, and allows
refactoring to be done (or undone) easily. Wrangler is such a tool that
supports interactive refactoring of Erlang programs. Wrangler currently
supports a number of basic Erlang refactorings, such as renaming of
variable/function/module names, generalisation of a function definition,
function extraction, folding against a function definition, duplicated code
detection, etc.</p>

<p>Built on top of the functionalities provided by the Erlang <code>syntax-tools</code>
package, Wrangler is embedded in the Emacs/Xemacs editing environment, and
makes use of the functionalities provided by Distel, an Emacs-based user
interface toolkit for Erlang, to manage the communication between the
refactoring tool and Emacs.</p>

<p>In collaboration with the <a href="http://erlide.sourceforge.net">Erlide</a>
team, we are now also in the process of integrating Wrangler with the
Eclipse Environment.</p>

<h3><a name="The_Interface_of_Wrangler">The Interface of Wrangler</a></h3>

<p>Below is a snapshot of Wrangler embedded in Emacs, which shows a particular
refactoring scenario. The user has selected the expression <code>
io:format("Hello") </code> in the definition of <code> repeat/1 </code>, has
chosen the <em>Generalise Function Definition </em> command from the <em>
Refactor </em> sub-menu, and has just entered a new parameter name A in the
mini-buffer.</p>

<p><img src="Wrangler1.JPG" alt="selecting a refactoring from the Emacs menu"> </p>

<p>The result of this refactoring is shown in the snapshot below.</p>

<p><img src="Wrangler2.JPG" alt="Emacs buffers after running the refactoring"> </p>

<p>Preview of the changes to be made by a refactoring is supported, and the
user could choose to commit or abort the refactoring result after preview.</p>

<p>All the implemented refactorings are module-aware. In the case that a
refactoring affects more than one module in the program, a message telling
which files have been modified by the refactorer will be given after the
refactoring has been successfully done. The <em>Customize Wrangler</em>
command from the <em>Refactor</em> sub-menu allows the user to specify the
boundary of the program, i.e., the directories that will be searched and
analysed by the refactorer, as shown in the example snapshot below.</p>

<p><img src="customize.JPG" alt="customizing Wrangler behaviour in Emacs"> </p>

<p><em>Undo</em> is supported by the refactorer. Applying undo once will revert
the program back to the status right before the last refactoring performed.
However, <em>PLEASE NOTE</em> that the refactorer undo is currently separate
from the Emacs undo, and undoing a refactoring will lose all the editing
activities after the refactoring.</p>

<h3><a name="Support_for_Macros">Support for Macros</a></h3>

<p>Wrangler makes use of functionalities provided by the <code>epp_dodger</code> module
from the Erlang <code>syntax_tools</code> library to parse Erlang source code, and
should be able to refactor Erlang modules containing preprocessor directives
and macro applications, as long as the macro definitions are syntactically
"well-behaved".</p>

<h3><a name="Refactoring_Code_with_Syntax_Errors">Refactoring Code with Syntax Errors</a></h3>

<p>Wrangler accepts Erlang programs with syntax errors or macro definitions
that cannot be parsed by <code>epp_dodger</code>. In the case that the program under
consideration has syntax errors or unparsable macros, functions/attributes
to which these syntax errors belong are not affected by the refactoring
process; however, warning messages asking for manual inspection of those
parts of the program are given after the refactoring.</p>

<h3><a name="Typed_Records_and_Type_Specifications">Typed Records and Type Specifications</a></h3>

<p>The current implementation of Wrangler does not support typed records and
type specifications yet; functionalities to support these features are being
added however.</p>

<h3><a name="How_to_Use_Wrangler">How to Use Wrangler</a></h3>

<ol>
 <li>Open an Erlang source file in the Emacs editor. You should now have a
     menu called <em>Erlang</em>, if you have configured Emacs properly to
     use the Erlang-mode (see the file INSTALL otherwise).
 </li>
 <li>To start Wrangler, type: <code>M-x erlang-wrangler-on</code>, or
     alternatively <code>Ctrl-c Ctrl-r</code>. After that, two new
     menus, <em>Refactor</em> and <em>Inspector</em>, should appear in the
     menu bar (see INSTALL otherwise).
 </li>
 <li>To stop Wrangler, type <code>M-x erlang-wrangler-off</code>, or
     alternatively use <code>Ctrl-c Ctrl-r</code> again. The Refactor and Inspector
     menus will disappear from the menu bar.
 </li>
 <li>You can use <code>Ctrl-c Ctrl-r</code> to toggle Wrangler on or off.
 </li>
 <li>For most refactorings, the editor interface will pass the current
     filename (should be the module name, as well), the refactoring command,
     and the current cursor position. For some refactorings, you'll also
     need to highlight an expression, or enter a new name.
 </li>
 <li>The <em>Customize Wrangler</em> menu in the Refactor submenu allows you
     to specify the boundary of the system by giving the list of directories
     to search for Erlang source files/header files that could be affected
     by a refactoring.
 </li>
</ol>

The following is the current list of refactorings:
<dl>
 <dt>Rename variable/function</dt>
 <dd>Place cursor at the identifier to be renamed; you'll be prompted for a
     new name.
 </dd>
 <dt>Rename module</dt>

 <dd>Place cursor anywhere within the module; you'll be prompted for a new
     name.
 </dd>
 <dt>Generalise definition</dt>
 <dd>Highlight the expression on which the function is going to be
     generalised, you'll be prompted for a new parameter name.
 </dd>
 <dt>Move a function definition to another module</dt>

 <dd>Place cursor anywhere within the function definition; you'll be
     prompted for the target module name.
 </dd>
 <dt>Function extraction</dt>
 <dd>highlight the expression/expression sequence that you wish to extract, you'll be prompted for a new function name.
 </dd>
 <dt>Fold expression against function</dt>
 <dd>Place cursor anywhere within the function clause. Wrangler will guide
     you through the possible candidates one by one, and ask whether you
     want to fold it or not.
 </dd>
 <dt>Introduce new macro</dt>
 <dd>Highlight the expression/pattern that you wish to replace with macro
     application, and you'll be prompted from a new macro name.
 </dd>
 <dt>Fold against macro definition</dt>
 <dd>Place cursor anywhere within the function definition. Wrangler will
     direct you through the possible candidates one by one, and for each
     candidate ask whether you want to fold it or not.
 </dd>
 <dt>Tuple function arguments</dt>
 <dd>Highlight the sequence of parameters to be grouped into a tuple from
     the function definition, then select the refactoring command from the
     menu.
 </dd>
 <dt>Identical expression search</dt>
 <dd>Highlight the expression/expression sequence you are interested in;
     Wrangler will show you the found expression/expression sequences.
 </dd>
 <dt>Detect identical code in current buffer</dt>
 <dd>Select the refactoring command from the menu. You'll be prompted for
     the minimum number of tokens a duplicated code fragment should have,
     and the number of times that a code fragment is duplicated.
 </dd>
 <dt>Detect identical code in directories</dt>
 <dd>Select the refactoring command from the menu, and you will be prompted
     for the minimum number of tokens a duplicated code fragment should
     have, and the minimum number of times that a code fragment is
     duplicated. Wrangler searches duplicated code fragments from the
     directories specified by the search-paths (see Customize Wrangler).
 </dd>
 <dt>Similar expression search</dt>
 <dd>Highlight the expression/expression sequence you are interested, select
     the command from the menu, and Wrangler will prompt you to input a
     similarity score.
 </dd>
 <dt>Detect similar code in current buffer</dt>
 <dd>Select the refactoring command from the menu, and you'll be prompted
     for 5 parameters, i.e. the minimum number of expressions in a
     expression sequence, the minimum number of tokens, the minimum and the
     maximum number of New_Vars, duplication, and a similarity score.
 </dd>
 <dt>Detect similar code in dirs</dt>
 <dd>Select the refactoring command from the menu, and you'll be prompted
     for 5 parameters, i.e. i.e. the minimum number of expressions in a
     expression sequence, the minimum number of tokens, the minimum and
     maximum number of New_Vars, duplication, and a similarity score.
     Wrangler searchs similar code in the directories specified by the
     search-paths (see Customize Wrangler).
 </dd>
 <dt>Rename a process</dt>
 <dd>Place the cursor at the process name to be renamed, and you will be
     prompted for the new name.
 </dd>
 <dt>Register a process</dt>
 <dd>Highlight the match expression whose right-hand side is the spawn
     expression that creates the process, and left-hand side is the process
     identifier, and you will be prompted for the new process name.
 </dd>
 <dt>From fun to process</dt>
 <dd>Place the cursor at the function name of the function definition to be
     refactored, and you will be prompted for the new process name.
 </dd>
 <dt>Add tag to messages</dt>
 <dd>Place the cursor at the function whose body contains the receive
     expression of the server process, and you will be prompted for the tag
     name.
 </dd>
 <dt>Unfold a function application</dt>
 <dd>Place the cursor at the function name part of the function application,
     then select the <em>Unfold Function Application</em> command.
 </dd>
 <dt>Introduce a ?LET</dt>
 <dd>Highlight the expression which should be a QC generator, then select
     the refactoring command; you will be prompted for the pattern variable
     name.
 </dd>
 <dt>Merge ?LETs</dt>
 <dd>Select the refactoring command, and Wrangler will guide you through the
     possible candidates one by one, and ask whether you want to merge it or
     not.
 </dd>
 <dt>Merge ?FORALLs</dt>
 <dd>Select the refactoring command, and Wrangler will guide you through the
     possible candidates one by one, and ask whether you want to merge it or
     not.
 </dd>
 <dt>eqc_statem State To Record</dt>
 <dd>Select the refactoring command, and Wrangler will check the current
     type of the state machine, and prompt you to input the record and field
     names if Wrangler is able to proceed the refactoring.
 </dd>
 <dt>eqc_fsm State To Record</dt>
 <dd>Select the refactoring command, and Wrangler will check the current
     type of the state machine, and prompt you to input the record and field
     names if Wrangler is able to process the refactoring.
 </dd>
 <dt>Introduce a new variable</dt>
 <dd>Highlight the expression of interest, then select <em>Introduce New
     Variable</em> from the Refactor menu; Wrangler will then prompt for the
     new variable name.
 </dd>
 <dt>Inline a variable</dt>
 <dd>To unfold a particular use instance of a variable, point the cursor to
     that instance, and then select <em>Inline Variable</em> from
     the <em>Refactor</em> menu. To unfold all (or some) uses of a variable,
     point the cursor to the defining occurrence of the variable and select
     the refactoring command. Wrangler will then search for uses of the
     selected variable, and let you choose which instances to unfold. Only
     variables defined via a match expression of the format <code>VarName = Expr</code>
     can currently be inlined.
